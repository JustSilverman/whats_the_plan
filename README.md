DevBootCamp Final Project
=========================

We have a live version at www.whatstheplan.co

Travel app that takes activities the user inputs and clusters the closest 4 together in order of activity, meal, activity, meal. 
Takes the work out of planning and let's you save time to enjoy the trip. 

Used the geocoder api, google maps api, yelp api, along with sidekiq and redis for background jobs.
